Technologies Used
CommerceCloud Central leverages a range of technologies to deliver a robust and scalable e-commerce solution:

Full-stack E-commerce Application Development: The project is built as a full-stack application, encompassing both front-end and back-end components to provide a complete e-commerce experience.
Admin Dashboard: A dedicated admin dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for managing products, inventory, customer reviews, and other aspects of the online store. This is usually built with a front-end framework.
Stripe: Stripe is used for secure and reliable payment processing. It handles sensitive payment information and ensures secure transactions.
Cloudinary: Cloudinary provides cloud-based image storage, optimization, and delivery. This allows for efficient management of product images and ensures optimal website performance by serving optimized images to users.
Folder Structure
A detailed folder structure is best derived from the actual project code, but generally, a full-stack e-commerce application like CommerceCloud Central will likely contain these top-level directories:

client/ or frontend/: Contains the front-end code (e.g., React components, styling, and assets).
server/ or backend/: Contains the back-end code (e.g., Node.js server, API endpoints, database models).
models/: Defines the data models for the application (e.g., Product, User, Order).
routes/: Defines the API routes for handling requests.
controllers/: Contains the logic for handling API requests.
config/: Configuration files for the application (e.g., database connection, API keys).
scripts/: Utility scripts for tasks like database seeding or deployment.
utils/: Utility functions that help with common tasks.
Within client/ you might find directories like components/ (reusable UI elements), pages/ (top-level routes), and styles/ (CSS or SASS files). Within server/ you might find middleware/ (authentication, logging).
